I traveled to Mexico in a  plane, it was so especial en awesome, I felt terrified at the begenning but then I felt the Heavenly Father helps and love and at the end a felt so good and it has been one of the most incredible experiences of my life. Then I got to Mexico City and I was in the MTC of the Church of Jesus Chris of Latter Days Sanits to prepar me to be a missionary to serve others.</p>
